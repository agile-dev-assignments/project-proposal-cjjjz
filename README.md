### Project title
RunNErrand

### What and why?
We want to develop a Web App that provides opportunities to students who want to earn some extra cash by connecting with others in their community.

Ideally, with this app, students in need of help will be able to post any customized tasks (as long as they’re legal), from academic assistance like tutoring to running errands for them, simply because they are lazy and willing to pay. Students who are able and willing to fulfill these tasks can place bids on the projects. After the task poster selecting the bid, the champion will be working on that task. Finally, after the task is completed, the task poster will be able to rate and leave comments on the order. In this way,  we can better the experience of our customers.

The inspiration comes from our idea to provide a more secure and convenient environment to solve students’ life troubles. We get a feeling that some students are craving for opportunities to earn more pocket money while others are struggling by the troubling errand and really need help(totally fine by paying money to do that ). So we provide such a terrace to fulfill both types of students’ needs with a negotiable price. And we believe that is meaningful.


### For whom?
Our target customers are college students in the US. 
We have two-end target customers.

People who posted jobs are specifically students who need someone to run small errands for them in a rush like fixing the water pipe. Or they need someone to buy a textbook they need in three hours from a bookstore three blocks away while they are currently unavailable to buy in person.

People who accept jobs are students who need part-time jobs and earn some pocket money. As long as they are in the nearby neighborhood, they have time and they are willing to do this work, they can accept the job on our app.

We want to provide an app only for college students and to secure our customers’ privacy and information security, we require every student to use their ‘edu’ email address while signing up for this app so that we can easily track both job providers and acceptors when there is an accident or dissatisfaction.


### How?
The Web app provides services to two ends: “Employer” and “Employee”. The “employers” are the customers who initiate a task, and they would be able to post requests for labor, chat with workers, and pay for services. The “employees” are the workers who accept the task, and they would be able to search for desired tasks, view job listings, chat with customers, and most importantly, get paid. 

The jobs or tasks could be listed and categorized in many different ways. In order to help customers to find a perfect fit from searching, the tasks could be listed by levels of difficulty, the skills that are required for doing the web, or time constraints. We may also allow the people to list their availability in their profile, so they could be found and reached out by others. The app may also be able to offer some free services like community services, or they even can reach out to others to study together. The app is not only about making money, but more importantly about connecting with the community and finding more interesting opportunities. 

Another important way of searching would be finding jobs around you. Since the services are limited to people who are studying and working inside education communities. We could group customers by schools and institutions. On campus, people could find tasks within the community. Outside of campus, people could search by choosing the traveling distance. In this way, customers could reach out different opportunities wherever they are staying. 

The system is designed for college students initially. One could simply demonstrate skills and characteristics through chatting with the employer, instead of attending those long and intimidating interviews. Gaining some experience from each task could also mean a big step. Similarly, employers, who are mostly students as well, could present the requirements for jobs in detail in the chat box. The chat function supports image, voice, and even video call if possible. 

All you need is a school email ending with edu. That’s how simple it is. 


### Scope
The essential idea behind our project is quite simple: allowing users to request for services or provide services. There are several impediments that we think our team might encounter, such as identity verification, task matching, visualization, and etc.
 
1. Identity verification: First, we only allow people with a valid organization email address in order to successfully register our application. Later, when we figured out a way to perform more advanced identity verification, we might expand out our target customers, allowing more people to register.

2. Task matching: To match users’ requests with services, we do this by asking users who have passed our identity verification and successfully registered for their further information, such as user’s specialties etc. If they intend to provide services, we ask for more detailed information about that service, such as the task that they are willing to do, the location they are currently at, and so on. Then, we extract the keywords from the task details that users provided, match the keywords with the same words on the requests, and then push the requests that are related to users’ specialties to them according to their location. For those who request for services, we ask for their location and the money they are willing to pay for the requested service, and then extract the keywords to perform task matching. 

3. Visualization: When the users enter the website or the app, they would be able to see several sections: searching, posting, chatting, and profile. In each of the sections the user would be able to search, post, chat, and edit their profile. Depending on time constraint and the skills level of our team member, we might also consider adding location and map visualization on our app if our team member would be able to finish the fundamental function of the app. If at the end, we would not be able to add the visualization of the map, we might consider some other ways to replace it in considering the completeness of the whole project. 

Based on the analysis, our team thinks that it is possible and attainable to achieve our project idea in this semester with high quality. We acknowledge that there might be some issues we have not considered, this project will be perfected as our work progress goes.
